- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with Chart.js for data visualization)
- **Database**: SQLite (default, suitable for development); PostgreSQL/MySQL recommended for production
- **Authentication**: Django's built-in authentication system
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with responsive design principles
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js for interactive charts

## Configuration for Production

To deploy the Expense Tracker in a production environment:

1. **Update Database Settings**:
   - Modify `settings.py` to use a production-ready database like PostgreSQL:
     ```python
     DATABASES = {
         'default': {
             'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
             'NAME': 'your_db_name',
             'USER': 'your_db_user',
             'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
             'HOST': 'localhost',
             'PORT': '5432',
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Set `DEBUG = False`**:
   - Update `settings.py` to disable debug mode:
     ```python
     DEBUG = False
     ```

3. **Collect Static Files**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ```

4. **Configure a Web Server**:
   - Use a WSGI server like Gunicorn and a reverse proxy like Nginx.
   - Example Gunicorn command:
     ```bash
     gunicorn --workers 3 expense_tracker.wsgi:application
     ```

5. **Secure the Application**:
   - Set up HTTPS using a certificate (e.g., Letâ€™s Encrypt).
   - Ensure environment variables are used for sensitive settings like `SECRET_KEY`.
